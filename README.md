# Helix
Helix is a passion driven project dedicated to innovating and reviving Souppvp, unlike other servers focused on monetization, Helix is built purely for the love of the game and the community that cherishes it. Our goal is to create a competitive, fair, and a satisfying experience for players.

We strongly believe in open communication with our player base. Every single change made to Helix is publicly announced, constructive criticism is always welcome, we want to hear from you and refine Helix based on player feedback.
Due to not all feedback being valid, we together as a community ensure to rely on numbers, graphs and statistical analysis to adjust gameplay, providing the excellent environment for all players. This is not just our server, it is yours as well.
